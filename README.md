# Atlas Agentic Workspace

Atlas is a web-based autonomous assistant that turns open-ended goals into actionable execution loops. The interface lets you configure how the agent reasons, capture ideas with one click, and follow along as it breaks down problems into analysis, plans, and next moves.

## ✨ Features

- **Agent Control Panel** – Toggle deep analysis, structured planning, and laser-focused next steps.
- **Conversation Feed** – Human + AI dialogue with contextual hints and reasoning-rich responses.
- **Quick Launch Prompts** – One-click starting points that prefill complex requests.
- **Adaptive Tone** – The agent adjusts narrative framing, steps, and focus based on your prompt.
- **Fluid UI** – Tailwind-powered design with glassmorphism panels and gradient ambience.

## 🚀 Getting Started

Install dependencies (npm is preconfigured):

```bash
npm install
```

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to explore the agent workspace.

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Enter a goal or choose a quick prompt.
2. Atlas analyses the request using heuristic intent detection.
3. Depending on enabled modes, it returns analysis, a structured plan, and the immediate next action.
4. Iterate on the conversation to refine direction or branch into new missions.
